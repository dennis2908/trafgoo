FAQ<br>
(Frequently Asked Questions)<br><br><br>

Q. How long do stories need to be?<br>
At Contests have ranged from 500 mini. to 2,000 max.<br>

Q. Why wonâ€™t you tell us the contest word count ahead of time?<br>
A. Because we have found that some write their stories ahead of time and then (crafty they are) creatively incorporate the contest topic into their almost-completed story.<br><br>

Q. Whatâ€™s the biggest mistake writers make in the contests?<br>
A. Bad endings! Oh, we do so detest bad endings! Predictable endings, poor and weak endingsâ€¦they can turn a wonderful story into a sour grape. Weâ€™ve read thousands of stories over the past two years and some absolutely wonderful and beautifully written stories end up losing on the last sentence. Itâ€™s sad, but itâ€™s very, very common. Hint: We LOVE surprises!<br><br>

Q. What should I avoid?<br>
A. Far too many stories come in with the main character being a writer. Please donâ€™t do that. It is far too common. Also, do NOT make the main character of your story named Angela and do not base your story in Bangor, Maine. These tactics are always used by a few in each contest and they donâ€™t work. In fact, making us think that favoritism because of a name or location will be used has the opposite effect on our judging. Good writing is what makes a winnerâ€¦not manipulation of the judges. Oh, and donâ€™t make your story about a writer who is participating in a writing contest but who canâ€™t come up with an idea on the topic. We always get a couple of those and that idea is pretty old by now. ðŸ˜‰<br><br>

Q. What is the judging process?<br>
A. Stories are read and broken down into two categories. Finalists versus other. The finalists are read and ranked by all judges. Using the rankings, we pick the top 23. These 23 are then re-read and ranked again by the judges and awarded either first, second, third place, or an honorable mention. All others are eligible for door prizes which are awarded at random.<br><br><br>
